# Number

Number is used to represent and manipulate numbers. To understand how the Number type works in Javascript, it is basically a value like double in c++ or java. This means that it can represent fractional values but there are some limits to what it can store. In addition Number is subject to rounding and when we have a very large number, higher than what Number can cover, this value is replaced by Infinity. 

The type Number has 3 symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity and NaN
